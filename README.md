# Translation, Chat, and Audio Processing App

## Project Overview

This project is a multilingual translation and chat application that supports translating text into English, Chinese, and Japanese, along with a chat interface. The app utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and advanced language models to process input and generate translations. The project aims to facilitate communication between users speaking different languages through both text and audio input.

## Features

- **Multilingual Translation**: Supports text translation into English, Chinese, and Japanese.
- **Chat Interface**: Enables conversations with real-time translations.
- **Audio Input**: Converts spoken language into text for translation (if supported by your implementation).
- **Language Models**: Uses state-of-the-art transformers for translation tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, Tokenizers
  - Audio Processing: PyDub, SpeechRecognition
  - Web Framework: Gradio or FastAPI (depending on your implementation)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained language models for translation tasks
